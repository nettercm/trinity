Source code for my autonomous mobile robot that will participate in the 2014 Trinity College Fire Fighting Home Robot Contest.

Consists of code that run on the robot itself ("robot" folder) as well as code that runs on a pc for teleoperation / debuggin / testing mode ("pc" folder).

Right now the source files contain a combination of unused left-over code from my 2013 version plus new code for this year's version - in other words the code could use plenty of cleanup and refactoring.  However, with the competition less then 1 month away, the focus right now is on making things work.
