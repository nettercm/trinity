    Change log:
    2009-07-06: 1.0.0 First release
    2010-07-21: New definition of OS_END that kills the running task. A task reaching the
    OS_END, will be killed. To make a task execute forever, a for(;;) loop must be implemented
    before the OS_END macro.

    2010-11-01: Replaced the return 0; with return; in the macros, so the task procedures
                can have return type void.

    2010-11-16: Change to uint16_t for the state variable in OS_BEGIN macro. Renamed the 
                state variable.
				
	2011-12-08: Changed the OS_WAIT_TICKS macro to include a clock id
    
    2012-01-04: Released under BSD license.
