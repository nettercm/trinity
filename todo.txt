High-priority:
* add start button
* create proper dog detection logic
* create proper "move to candle" logic
* add sound activation


Wall following:
•	Add logic to "follow wall" behavior so that it first finds the wall or create a separate "find wall" behavior
•	Limit the amount by which the integrator is increased/decreased (new parameter!)
•	Add special logic to better handle inside corners

General Motor control / locomotion:
•	Add slew-rate limiting to the motor command (to avoid reset due to over-current; don’t apply to slowing down, just for speeding up and changing direction)  
	o	(10 per interval @ 50hz/20ms => 0.5s for full 0-255 PWM range)


General:
* add an API to start/stop a behavior & to wait for it to complete.

start_behavior(b, s1?)						//start behavior b in state s1
start_behavior_and_wait(b, s1?, s2?)		//start behavior b in state s1 and wait until it reaches s2
stop_behavior(b)							//stop behavior b
get_behavior_state(b)




Issues:

* when turning into room #4 w/ door on the south side - turning too sharp
* sometimes missing the line/door when entering room 1 w/ door on the south side
* BT1 Bluetooth module seems to have stopped working.  It will pair, but can't exchange data.  Using BT2 now.




Notes:

motor command for turning:
1) gradually ramp up (at specified rate) to target speed
2) when we are <= 30degrees from the target, start ramping down to speed 15
3) when we are <= 10degrees from the target, apply target speed 5 (w/ feed forward) & regulate to maintain 5
3) when we are at the target, hit the brakes - full stop w/out ramping down

i2c 20x4 LCD:
5mA + 30mA for the backlight
123ms for 80 characters @ 100khz i2c speed  (1540us per character)
55ms for 80 characters @ 400khz i2c speed  (690us per character)
Arduino i2c speed is controlled by TWI_FREQ macro in twi.h;  default is 100khz

How to fix the issue of USB serial port / bluetooth module being confused as a serial mouse:
Location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\sermouse
Key: Start
Value: 3
Change Value to 4, which is Disabled and it will stop this problem occurring
