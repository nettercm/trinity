Wall following:
•	Add logic to "follow wall" behavior so that it first finds the wall or create a separate "find wall" behavior
•	Limit the amount by which the integrator is increased/decreased (new parameter!)
•	Add special logic to better handle inside corners

General Motor control / locomotion:
•	Add slew-rate limiting to the motor command (to avoid reset due to over-current; don’t apply to slowing down, just for speeding up and changing direction)  
	o	(10 per interval @ 50hz/20ms => 0.5s for full 0-255 PWM range)
